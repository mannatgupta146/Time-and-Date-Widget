The widget dynamically updates the time and date every second, with vibrant color-coded time elements (Hours: Orange, Minutes: Blue, Seconds: Red). The date is displayed in a calm cyan tone for easy readability.

## How it Works

1. **HTML Structure**: The HTML provides the basic structure of the widget, including placeholders for displaying the time and date (`.clock-container` for the time and `.date-container` for the date).
2. **JavaScript**: The JavaScript file (`script.js`) handles the dynamic behavior. It uses the `Date()` object to get the current time, day, and date. The time is updated every second using `setInterval()`, and the display is updated by modifying the DOM.
   - The `formatTime()` function ensures the time is displayed in the "00:00:00" format.
   - The `updateClock()` function updates both the time and date every second.
3. **CSS Styling**: The CSS defines the look of the widget, with smooth transitions, gradient backgrounds, and color-coded time elements.
   - It uses media queries to make the widget responsive on different screen sizes.
   - Hover effects are included for an interactive feel, where the widget scales up and enhances its shadow.
